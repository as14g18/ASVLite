# Simulating an ASV Swarm for Marine Environments using ASVLite

## Introduction
ASV swarms can be difficult and expensive to deploy in the real world, which is why high-fidelity simulations are required to design and test ASVs before deploying them. In this paper, we propose a high-performance, high-fidelity ASV swarm simulator rendering tool. The tool will allow users to visualise different swarm behaviours such as line-sweeping, patrolling, and station-keeping. A behaviour-based approach is used to train the ASVs in conjunction with PID controllers to control the ASV actuation. In addition, the swarm of ASVs is a sparse swarm, meaning the ASVs are around 1,000 body lengths apart. Two low-power, long-range wireless communications systems, LoRaWAN and Iridium Satellite Constellation, are compared to more accurately model the latency that would be experienced in such a decentralised sparse swarm. 

The simulator being used for this project is [ASVLite: a high-performance simulator for autonomous surface vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04599).

The image below show visualisation of the ocean surface and three ASVs simulated by ASVLite.

## Build instruction
``` 
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/resilient-swarms/asv-swarm.git
cd asv-swarm
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make 
```

## Running the simulator

The simulator requires the following values as command-line arguments:
1. input file, 
2. output file,
3. significant wave height of the sea state to simulate, 
4. predominant wave direction of the wave,
5. random seed number.

Example for simulating vehicle dynamics in a sea with a significant wave height of 1.2 m, wave heading of 20<sup>o</sup>North and with a random number seed of 3:
```
asv_simulator input_file out_file 1.2 20.0 3
```

The `input_file` uses `toml` syntax and should provide the inputs required for the simulation. Given below is an example of an input file.
